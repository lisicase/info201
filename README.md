# **Domain of Interest: Education**
## Why are you interested in this field/domain?
There are a lot of interesting questions to be asked about the education spending
throughout the past 3 decades, such as how nation social or political events
affect different counties and states differently. Did Washington increase
education spending in response to President Bill Clinton's illegal immigration
reform more than Texas did? How has the education spending by district in New
York changed over the years, with respect to gentrification? How does educational spending impact the youth? Performing this
data analysis would allow us to have a convenient resource that allows us to
answer questions such as this.

  - The top three questions above can be answered using this dataset in conjunction with those from other years. This particular dataset allows us to see what U.S. education spending looked like in the middle range of the last 30 years, in the midst of Immigration Reform, and specifically during the year of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. With data on the value of the dollar, we can also see how this spending in 2006 relates to that of other years, and how changes compare to inflation.

  - This data was compiled by GitHub user "ecodan" based on information from the [dataset underlying the Pah/Amaral/Hagan research](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/01/shootings-us-schools-link-unemployment) and a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shootings_in_the_United_States) on school shootings in the U.S. from 1990 to present. Pah compiled the first source by compiling previously-used data sets, reading reports on each incident of gun violence and establishing criteria for what constituted an incident. Wikipedia's list is compiled from various reports, added by various contributors. This particular dataset details the reported number of school shootings in the U.S., broken down by year and type of school (level and public vs. private.

  - This dataset was collected by the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (URC). The arrests are by offense and categorized by age, sex, and sometimes race. The URC considers juveniles to be any individual under 18 years old. The years in this dataset range from 1995-2016.
  - How many observations (rows) are in your data?
    - 1920
  - How many features (columns) are in the data?
    - 4
  - What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
    - The last question can be answered by grouping this dataset and the education spending datasets by year. After this grouping the datasets can be joined and trends in educational spending and juvenile crime rates will be analyzed.
